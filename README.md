# Camus Mode

My minimalist Emacs workflow optimized for writing prose in Markdown and CSS.

## Getting Started

Linux:

     sudo apt-get install emacs
     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
	 cask install

OSX:

    brew install emacs --cocoa --srgb brew linkapps Emacs
	brew install cask
	cask install
	
Clone this repo into ~/.emacs.d and start Emacs. If all goes well your emacs is good to go.
